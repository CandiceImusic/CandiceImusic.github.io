Uhh uhh uhh<br/>
You ready B? Let's go get 'em...<br/>
Look for me<br/>
Young B<br/>
Cruisin' down the westside highway<br/>
Doin' what we like to do our way<br/>
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason<br/>
All of my dates been blind dates<br/>
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me<br/>
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy<br/>
How hard she rides wit me - the new Bobby and Whitney<br/>
Only time we don't speak is durin' "Sex and the City"<br/>
She gets Carrie feva, but soon as the show's ova<br/>
She's right back to being my soldier<br/>
Cuz mami's a rida, and I'm a rolla<br/>
Put us togetha, how they gon' stop both us?<br/>
Whateva she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder<br/>
When I'm off track mami is keepin' me focused<br/>
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be<br/>
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B, holla<br/>

Jay-Z: All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend （me and my Girlfriend）<br/>
Beyonce: Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend （me and My boyfriend）<br/>
Jay-Z: All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend （me and my Girlfriend）<br/>
Beyonce: Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend （me and My boyfriend）<br/>

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'<br/>
Wit the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'<br/>
That ain't 'bout nuttin' - if eva you mad about sunntin'<br/>
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that<br/>
I don't be at, places where we comfy at<br/>
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that<br/>
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this earth's surface is<br/>
But girlfriend, work wit the kid<br/>
I keep you workin' that Hermes Birkin bag<br/>
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens<br/>
600 drops, Mercedes Benz<br/>
The only time you wear Burberry to swim<br/>
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him<br/>
She do anything necessary for him<br/>
And I do anything necessary for Her<br/>
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!
